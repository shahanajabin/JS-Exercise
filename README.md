39. Write a JavaScript program to concatenate two strings and return the result. If the length of the strings are not same then remove the characters from the longer string. 
40. Write a JavaScript program to rotate the elements left of a given array of integers of length 3.  
41. Write a JavaScript program to check whether 1 appears in first or last position of a given array of integers. The array length must be greater or equal to 1.   
42. Write a JavaScript program to find the larger value between the first or last and set all the other elements with that value. Display the new array.    
43. Write a JavaScript program to test whether an array of integers of length 2 contains 1 or a 3.     
44. Write a JavaScript code to divide a given array of positive integers into two parts. First element goes to first part, second element goes to second part, and third element goes to first part and so on. Now compute the sum of two parts and store into an array of size two.  
45. Write a JavaScript program to check whether two arrays of integers of same length are similar or not. The arrays will be similar if one array can be obtained from another array by swapping at most one pair of elements.  
46. Write a JavaScript program to find the kth greatest element of a given array of integers

52. Write a JavaScript program to check whether a matrix is a diagonal matrix or not. In linear algebra, a diagonal matrix is a matrix in which the entries outside the main diagonal are all zero (the diagonal from the upper left to the lower right). 
Example:
[1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 3] ]) = true
[1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 3], [0, 0, 3] ]) = false
53. Write a JavaScript program to check whether a given matrix is an identity matrix. 
Note: In linear algebra, the identity matrix, or sometimes ambiguously called a unit matrix, of size n is the n ? n square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]] -> true
[[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]] -> false
54. Write a JavaScript program to check whether a given matrix is lower triangular or not. 
Note: A square matrix is called lower triangular if all the entries above the main diagonal are zero.
